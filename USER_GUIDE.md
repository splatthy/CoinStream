## Getting Started

The Crypto Trading Journal helps you track, analyze, and improve your cryptocurrency trading performance.

Important: In the current MVP, importing is CSVâ€‘based via Transaction/Order History (fills). Position History imports and API sync are removed.

### What You'll Need

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- A web browser to access the application

1. **Setup the Application**
   ```bash
   ./setup-production.sh
   ```

2. **Access the Application**
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Import Your Data**
   - Go to the Import Data page
   - Upload your order/transaction history CSV (fills)
   - Preview reconstructed positions and import closed trades

5. **Start Analyzing**
   - View your trades in the Trade History page
   - Analyze performance in the Trend Analysis page
   - Study confluence effectiveness in the Confluence Analysis page

## Application Setup

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory**: Minimum 1GB RAM, recommended 2GB+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Can't access the application at localhost:8501

**Solutions**:
1. Check if Docker is running:
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```

2. Verify the container is running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
   ```

3. Check for port conflicts:
   ```bash
   netstat -tulpn | grep 8501
   ```

4. Review container logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs
   ```

#### API Connection Failures

**Symptoms**: "Connection failed" when testing API keys

**Solutions**:
1. Verify API key is correct and active
2. Check if API key has proper permissions (read access)
3. Ensure your IP is not blocked by the exchange
4. Check exchange API status
5. Review application logs for detailed error messages

#### Data Not Syncing

**Symptoms**: No new trades appearing after sync

**Solutions**:
1. Check API connection status in Config page
2. Verify you have recent trading activity
3. Check if your positions are fully closed
4. Review sync logs for errors
5. Try manual refresh

#### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: Application is slow or unresponsive

**Solutions**:
1. Check available system memory
2. Restart the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart
   ```
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check for large datasets that might need optimization

### Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check Logs**: Always check application logs first
2. **Review Documentation**: Ensure you've followed setup instructions correctly
3. **Verify Prerequisites**: Confirm Docker and system requirements are met
4. **Test Connectivity**: Verify network connectivity to exchanges

### Log Files

Access logs using:
```bash
# View recent logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs --tail=100

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# View logs for specific time period
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs --since="1h"
```

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **API Key Management**
   - Use read-only API keys only
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Never share API keys
   - Use IP restrictions when possible

2. **System Security**
   - Keep Docker updated
   - Use strong passwords for system accounts
   - Don't expose the application to the internet without authentication
   - Regular security updates

### Data Management

1. **Regular Backups**
   ```bash
   # Create backup
   tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz data/
   ```

2. **Data Validation**
   - Regularly verify trade data accuracy
   - Cross-check with exchange records
   - Monitor for missing or duplicate trades

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Sync data regularly to avoid large imports
   - Archive old data if performance degrades
   - Monitor disk space usage

### Trading Analysis

1. **Confluence Tagging**
   - Be consistent with confluence naming
   - Tag trades immediately after closing
   - Use specific, descriptive confluence names
   - Review and update confluence definitions regularly

2. **Performance Review**
   - Analyze performance weekly/monthly
   - Focus on confluence effectiveness
   - Identify patterns in winning/losing trades
   - Adjust strategy based on data insights

3. **Record Keeping**
   - Keep detailed notes on trading decisions
   - Document market conditions
   - Track emotional state during trades
   - Review and learn from both wins and losses

### System Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**
   ```bash
   # Update application
   ./setup-production.sh --update
   ```

2. **Resource Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Check resource usage
   docker stats
   ```

3. **Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Clean up unused Docker resources
   ./setup-production.sh --cleanup
   ```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Confluence Types

You can define custom confluence types in the Config page:

1. Navigate to Config page
2. Find the "Custom Fields" section
3. Add new confluence options
4. Save configuration
5. Use new confluences when tagging trades

### Data Export

Export your data for external analysis:

1. Use the export features in each page
2. Data is exported in CSV format
3. Import into Excel, Google Sheets, or other tools
4. Combine with external data sources for deeper analysis

### Integration with Other Tools

The application stores data in JSON format in the `data/` directory:

- `trades.json`: All trade records
- `config.json`: Application configuration
- `credentials.enc`: Encrypted API credentials

You can build custom tools that read this data for additional analysis.
