# Transaction/Order History Import ‚Äî Task Breakdown (MVP + Post‚ÄëMVP)

This tasks document translates `specs/transaction_order_history_definition.md` into self‚Äëcontained, actionable units. Each task includes the context needed to work independently in a fresh chat.

References:
- Definition: `specs/transaction_order_history_definition.md`
- Current CSV stack: `app/services/csv_import/*`
- UI: `app/pages/csv_import.py`
- Trade model: `app/models/trade.py`
- Config service: `app/services/config_service.py`

Conventions:
- Persist only fully closed positions (MVP).
- Fees stored as single `custom_fields['fees']` stringified Decimal; do not double‚Äësubtract when PnL provided by exchange.
- Time parsing to UTC, timezone‚Äënaive.

## T1 ‚Äî Exchange Detection and File Routing

- Summary: Detect Bitunix futures‚Äëhistory and Blofin order history headers and route to the tx‚Äëhistory ingestion path.
- Context: We are deprecating Position History imports. Input sources are fills (Bitunix `futures-history-*.csv`, Blofin `Order_history_*.csv`).
- Inputs (headers):
  - Bitunix: `date, side, futures, average price, executed, fee, realized p/l, status`.
  - Blofin: `Underlying Asset, Margin Mode, Leverage, Order Time, Side, Avg Fill, Filled, Fee, PNL, Reduce-only, Status`.
- Implementation:
  - Update `app/services/csv_import/column_mapper.py` or a new router to positively match the above headers.
  - Route to a new tx‚Äëhistory path (normalizer ‚Üí dedupe ‚Üí reconstructor) instead of `DataTransformer.transform_row`.
- Acceptance:
  - Given either header set, service selects tx‚Äëhistory path.
  - Non‚Äëmatching files raise a clear validation error with expected columns summary.

## T2 ‚Äî Fills Normalizer (Unit Stripping + Action/Side Derivation)

- Summary: Parse raw CSV rows into normalized fills.
- Context: Definition ‚Üí Normalized Fill Schema. Side/action rules:
  - Bitunix `side`: `Open Long/Short` ‚Üí open; `Close Long/Short` ‚Üí close.
  - Blofin `Side`: `Open*` ‚Üí open, `Close*`/`Close*(SL)` ‚Üí close; `Reduce-only == Y` forces close.
- Inputs:
  - Bitunix fields: `date, side, futures, average price, executed, fee, realized p/l, status`.
  - Blofin fields: `Order Time, Side, Underlying Asset, Avg Fill, Filled, Fee, PNL, Reduce-only, Status, Margin Mode, Leverage`.
- Implementation:
  - New module `app/services/csv_import/tx_history/normalizer.py` with a `normalize(file_df, exchange)` API returning a list of fills dicts with keys: `exchange, symbol, time, action, side, price, quantity, fee, pnl?, margin_mode?, leverage?, reduce_only?`.
  - Unit stripping helpers for values like `"0.0312 USDT"` and `"9621 ALT"`.
  - Filter to `Status == Filled` (or `FILLED`) and `quantity > 0`.
- Acceptance:
  - Sample rows from both CSVs produce expected normalized fills; numeric fields are Decimals (or serializable strings), symbols uppercased, actions and sides correct.

## T3 ‚Äî Tolerant Dedupe Hashing for Fills

- Summary: Remove duplicate fills across re‚Äëexports with rounding.
- Context: Definition ‚Üí Deduplication Policy.
- Implementation:
  - New helper `app/services/csv_import/tx_history/dedupe.py` implementing rounded canonical string keys:
    - Bitunix key: `(date, futures, side, average price, executed, status[, fee])`.
    - Blofin key: `(Order Time, Underlying Asset, Side, Avg Fill, Filled, Status[, Fee])`.
  - Rounding constants: price 1e‚Äë6, quantity 1e‚Äë8, fee 1e‚Äë8, pnl 1e‚Äë8; whitespace collapse; uppercase symbols.
- Acceptance:
  - Duplicate lines in provided samples collapse to a single fill; non‚Äëduplicates pass through.

## T4 ‚Äî Position Reconstructor (State Machine)

- Summary: Reconstruct closed positions from normalized fills per `(symbol, side[, margin_mode])`.
- Context: Definition ‚Üí Reconstruction Algorithm and PnL/Fees semantics.
- Implementation:
  - New module `app/services/csv_import/tx_history/reconstructor.py` with `reconstruct(fills)` ‚Üí list of Closed Trade DTOs (not the model yet).
  - Track open_qty, entry_vwap, open_fees, close_fees, realized_pnl_sum, entry_time, exit_vwap, exit_time.
  - Use provided per‚Äëfill PnL on close fills when present; else compute gross from VWAP and subtract accumulated fees to get net.
  - Emit trade when qty ‚Üí 0 within tolerance; carry remaining states as in‚Äëprogress (returned separately for preview).
- Acceptance:
  - Sequences with scale‚Äëin/out yield correct VWAPs, fees, and net PnL; in‚Äëprogress positions identified.

## T5 ‚Äî CSVImportService Integration (Tx‚ÄëHistory Path)

- Summary: Wire normalization ‚Üí dedupe ‚Üí reconstruction into the import flow.
- Implementation:
  - Extend `CSVImportService` with a branch for tx‚Äëhistory flow.
  - Preview: show Raw fills or Reconstructed Positions (toggle); mark computed values with üßÆ.
  - Import: persist only closed trades via `DataService`.
- Acceptance:
  - Import summary reports total rows, deduped, closed persisted, open skipped, errors/warnings.

## T6 ‚Äî Fees and PnL Semantics

- Summary: Align with exchange semantics where realized PnL is net of fees.
- Context: Exchange UIs indicate realized PnL includes fees (Bitunix: Closed PnL + Funding + Trading; Blofin: Closed PnL + Trading).
- Implementation:
  - When PnL provided: treat as net; do not subtract fees again. Persist `custom_fields['fees']` separately.
  - When PnL missing: compute gross (VWAPs), then net = gross ‚àí total_fees.
- Acceptance:
  - No double counting of fees; spot checks on sample rows match expected net behavior.

## T7 ‚Äî Capital, Risk, and Max Loss Snapshot

- Summary: On import, attach `max_risk_per_trade` when app config has Capital and Risk %; support UI override.
- Implementation:
  - Config: read `portfolio_size` and `risk_percent` from `ConfigService` (or placeholder keys) to compute `estimated_risk_per_trade`.
  - On emitting Closed trades, set `custom_fields['max_risk_per_trade']` and `custom_fields['risk_source']='calculated'` when available.
  - Table UI: breach notice when `pnl < 0` and `abs(pnl) > max_risk_per_trade`.
  - Inline editor: allow manual edit; if user clicks Recalculate, recompute from current config and set `risk_source='calculated'`.
- Acceptance:
  - Trades created during import carry max risk when config exists; UI correctly flags breaches; manual override persists.

## T8 ‚Äî Import Audit Trail and Incremental Window

- Summary: Record imports and suggest next time window.
- Implementation:
  - Model: simple import log persisted under `data/` (JSON or Parquet), capturing `import_id, timestamp, exchange, account_label?, file_hash, counts, risk_config_snapshot`.
  - Maintain `last_import_time` per `(exchange, account_label)`; propose default filter `time > last_import_time` in UI.
  - UI: optional `Account Label` on import form; disclaimer if empty and multiple accounts suspected.
- Acceptance:
  - After an import, a new log entry exists; subsequent import proposes a start time after the last one and is overrideable.

## T9 ‚Äî UI Updates (Import + Preview + Risk)

- Summary: Update Streamlit page for tx‚Äëhistory path, preview toggles, account label, and risk display.
- Implementation (in `app/pages/csv_import.py`):
  - Add Account Label field (optional) and surface exchange auto‚Äëdetection.
  - Preview toggle: Raw fills vs Reconstructed Positions (badges: üßÆ Derived, In‚ÄëProgress).
  - Risk: show `max_risk_per_trade` column and breach highlighting.
- Acceptance:
  - Users can label imports, see correct previews, and breach notices render for losses exceeding max risk.

## T10 ‚Äî Tests (Units + Integration)

- Summary: Validate normalization, dedupe, reconstruction, risk, and import orchestration.
- Implementation:
  - Unit: normalizer (unit stripping, action/side), dedupe (rounding), reconstructor (VWAP/PnL/fees), risk snapshot logic.
  - Integration: end‚Äëto‚Äëend import on sample Bitunix and Blofin files; verify counts and stored trades.
- Acceptance:
  - All tests pass; coverage for core logic; sample inputs work as expected.

## T11 ‚Äî Documentation and Templates

- Summary: Document CSV formats and onboarding new exchanges.
- Implementation:
  - Update `specs/transaction_order_history_definition.md` if needed.
  - Add format notes for Bitunix/Blofin order history (headers, field meanings, examples).
  - Developer notes: how to add a new exchange to the tx‚Äëhistory path.
- Acceptance:
  - Docs render in repo; clearly describe inputs and behavior.

## T12 ‚Äî Migration and Cleanup

- Summary: Remove Position History importer and Aggregated Positions view, and provide fresh‚Äëstart guidance.
- Implementation:
  - Hide/remove Position History code paths and UI toggles.
  - Add a brief note in README/USER_GUIDE about clearing previous data and re‚Äëimporting using tx‚Äëhistory.
- Acceptance:
  - UI no longer shows Position History paths; app functions with tx‚Äëhistory only.
